    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages and applications.
    It was first introduced in <b><u>1991 by Tim Berners-Lee</u></b>, a British computer scientist 
    who is considered the inventor of the World Wide Web. HTML allows users to structure and format
    content on the web, including text, images, videos, and links. Since its introduction, HTML has
    gone through several versions, with HTML5 being the latest and most widely used version. HTML 
    has revolutionized the way we access and share information, and has played a crucial role in
    the growth of the internet as we know it today.

    <h2 class="headings ">HTML tags</h2>
    <pre class="text3">
        In HTML, tags are used to define and structure content on web pages. Each tag is
        enclosed in angle brackets < > and has a specific purpose. Here are some important 
        HTML tags and their specifications:

        &#149<b> &#60html>:</b> This is the top-level tag that encloses all other tags in an HTML document.
                         It defines the beginning and end of an HTML document.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60head>:</b> This tag contains meta-information about the HTML document  , such as   the 
                         title of the page,links to stylesheets, and scripts.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60body>:</b> This tag contains the visible content of  the HTML   document, such as text,   
                         images, videos, and links.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60h1> to &#60h6>:</b>  These   tags define headings of   different levels,   with &#60h1>
                         being the largest and most important and &#60h6> being the smallest and least important.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60p>:</b> tag defines a paragraph of text.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60ul> and &#60ol>:</b> These tags define unordered and ordered lists, respectively.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60li>:</b> This tag defines a list item within a list.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60a>:</b> This tag defines a hyperlink to another web page or document.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60img>:</b> This tag defines an image to be displayed on the web page.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60table>:</b> This tag defines a table with rows and columns.<br>
        &#149 <b>&#60form>:</b> This tag defines a form for user input, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons.<br>
        &#149<b> &#60input>:</b> This tag defines an input field for user input, such as text, numbers,
                        or email addresses.<br>
            These are just a few of the many HTML tags available. Using the appropriate tags and attributes
            helps to structure and format content on web pages, making them more accessible, user-friendly,
            and search engine optimized.

    <h2 class="headings">Future Use of HTML</h2>
    <p class="text5">
        HTML has come a long way since its inception, and its future use will continue to shape the web as we know it.
        One potential area of growth is the continued development of web components, which allow developers to 
        create reusable, customizable components for web applications. Web components are based on custom
        elements, shadow DOM,and HTML templates, and offer a new way to create modular and scalable web applications.
        Another area of potential growth is the use of HTML in augmented and virtual reality applications, 
        as the &#60canvas> tag and other HTML features can be used to create interactive graphics and 
        animations. Additionally, with the rise of IoT devices, HTML may be used to create web-based 
        interfaces for controlling and monitoring smart devices. As accessibility standards and guidelines
        continue to evolve, HTML will alsocontinue to play a crucial role in ensuring that web content is 
        accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Overall, the future of HTML is likely to 
        be shaped by emerging technologies and changing userneeds, and HTML will continue to be a key part of 
        creating rich, dynamic, and accessible web content.
